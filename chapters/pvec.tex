\chapter{Definition of RRB-Tree in Rust}

- How can we represent a persistent vector (dag) in memory?
    - Which type of memory are we going to use \& why? Is it possible to use only stack or heap?
        - Is it possible to define a recursive type allocated on stack?
        - Size of the data structure is not fixed, hence it is impossible to predetermine the size of the stack during compilation time
- Why Arc<>?
- Multiple owners
- Copy-on-write semantics (see linked draft with diagrams))
- Reference counting \& deallocation
