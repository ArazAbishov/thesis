\section*{Acknowledgements}

\end{center}

I would like to thank my supervisors, Martin Steffen and Volker Stolz, for their guidance and feedback. Without their patience and support, as well as trust in my own idea, this venture would not have been possible.

My deepest appreciation goes to my family and my friends for their moral support, their continuous encouragement, and their help whenever it was needed.

Finally, I would like to thank the Rust community for being so welcoming and supportive. In particular, I am grateful to Nicholas Matsakis for inspiring me to work on this project.
