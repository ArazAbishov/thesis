    \begin{itemize}
        \item 2 stages (why?) are general (shade the light on work, motivation)
        \item 1 stage (what?) should be more specific about this paper (mention what has been achieved)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Thoughts}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Influence on software design
    \item Immutability, concurrency and functional programming languages
    \item Applications in particular problem domains
    \item Why vectors in particular?
\end{itemize}
