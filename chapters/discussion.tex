% ToDo:
%  - Reconsider if specifying the sample count and count of runs per sample is useful. 
%  - Fill-in more details on how benchmarks are analyzed from Criterion's documentation
%  - Re-introduce what is a black box, and update benchmarks to avoid misusing it. 
%  - You need to be careful with using next words interchangeably: profile, measure, benchmark
%  - What bootstrap sampling means?
%  - What kind of benchmarks are you presenting? Throughput or latency?

% Notes from the criterion documentation: 
% - Note from Criterion: note that Criterion.rs does not measure each individual iteration, only the complete sample. The resulting samples are stored for use in later stages.
% - These two timing loops generate a batch of inputs and measure the time to execute the benchmark on all values in the batch. As with iter_with_large_drop they also collect the values returned from the benchmark into a Vec and drop it later without timing the drop. 
% - Keep in mind that this is only necessary if the benchmark modifies the input - if the input is constant then one input value can be reused and the benchmark should use iter instead.
% - You should write about what is drop in Rust, and how it is relevant in Criterion benchmarks (whether it is being measured as well or not).

\subsection{Indexing}

In this section we will look at the performance of the index operation in practice. The evaluation will include two common use cases, such as accessing elements sequentially and randomly. % ToDo: add more points here later

\subsubsection*{Index Sequentially}

Accessing elements sequentially is a common way of reading values from a vector. The following benchmark is dedicated to understanding the performance properties of \rbtree{} and \rrbtree{} based vector implementations in comparison to the vector from the Rust's standard library. 

As the size influences the internal representation of a vector, it is critical to ensure that it performs well consistently over a wide range of inputs. The results will reveal whether the size based optimization is effective, and how sigfnicant the impact of the increasing height of \rbtree{} and \rrbtree{} is. 

The problem size interval is [10, 1M]\todo{typesetting?}, with a number of values in between. The average run time for each given problem size is recorded as the result in \ref{fig:index-sequentially}. 

The benchmark consists of two parts: the setup routine and the actual test function. The setup routine, however, differs for the balanced and unbalanced flavors of vectors. 

The balanced vector is created by pushing elements \footnote{The type of elements is a 64-bit unsigned integer.} into it, while an unbalanced one is created by concatenating several small vectors together. The test function loops over the [0, N] interval retrieving corresponding values from a vector, where N \todo{typesetting?} is the problem size.

% TODO:
%  - Insert the benchmarks for iterator_next
%  - Role of transience in this benchmark
%  - Rc vs Arc (you will need to sub-merge results of that run into the plot?)
%  - Claimed perf guarantees in big-o notation

Unsurprisingly, the \stdvec{} shows the best results in this test. As it is backed by a contiguous chunk of memory, it takes full advantage of cache locality. In addition, its structure is not affected by the method used to build it, when \rbtree{} and \rrbtree{} based vectors are. 

\paragraph{Dynamic internal representation}

\pvec{} switches its internal representation from the standard vector to \rrbvec{} when the count of elements surpasses a certain threshold, which was set to 4096 in this case. This is evident from the plot \ref{fig:index-sequentially}, where \pvec{} is 3.44x faster than balanced \rrbvec{}, but slower than \stdvec{} by a factor of 1.79x. It is slower because of the overhead induced by acquiring a mutable reference to \rc{} pointer. As soon as the threshold is passed, the difference in performance between \pvec{} and \rrbvec{} becomes negligible. 

% ToDo: should you check error margins, and use them as reference for negligible differences? 

\paragraph{Balanced vs unbalanced variants}
The difference between the balanced and unbalanced \rrbvec{} becomes noticeable as the problem size grows. The balanced variant is faster than the unbalanced one by a factor of 1.68x in the [100, 1M] input range. This is expected, because the unbalanced variant introduces relaxed nodes, which rely on the size tables to compute the path to the value. 

This, however, is not the case for small problem sizes in the [0, 100] range, for which the concatenating algorithm produces a well balanced tree. Hence, both balanced and unbalanced vectors have identical performance numbers in that range. 

Both balanced and unbalanced \imrsvec{} variants tend to be slower in comparison to \rrbvec{} in the [100, 1M] input range] by a factor of 4.1x. However, for smaller inputs it is slightly faster with a difference of 1.18x. 

% ToDo: be more explicit when it comes to comparison to std, because now there is almost no mention do how fast or slow PVec is. 

\paragraph*{Rc vs Arc}
\todo{Run benchmarks for Arc}

\subsubsection*{Index Randomly}
In this benchmark, rather than accessing consecutive indices, we will get elements at random positions. From the algorithmic point of view, the implementation of the operation itself is the same. The difference is mostly in the behavior of processor caches, which will be invalidated if the requested element is out of reach. This is quite likely to happen as indices are picked randomly. In addition, the results will clarify whether the performance degenerates with randomness, as it would with linked lists for example. 

\paragraph*{Setup}
The setup routine is identical to the one in the index sequentially benchmark. The difference is in the actual test routine itself, where the \todo{ref} \emph{rnd} library is used to generate indices randomly. 

\paragraph*{Dynamic internal representation}
It is clear that \pvec{} is as fast as \stdvec{} up to the size of 4096, right after which it becomes slower and aligns with the \rrbvec{}. Even then, however, performance difference between \stdvec{} and \pvec{} is not significant, remaining quite consistent over the rest of the input range at 2.7x. 

\paragraph*{Balanced vs unbalanced variants}
Both variants perform well, with the balanced \rrbvec{} being faster by 1.36x in [100, 1M] range. Both unbalanced \rrbvec{} and \imrsvec{} are equally fast with insignificant marginal differences.

\subsection{Updating}

\subsection{Pushing}
\todo{move the description of benchmarks to the evaluation chapter} 

The push operation is used to append a new value to the end of the vector. It is also responsible for managing the capacity and the internal representation of a vector as the size growth. For example, the \stdvec{} increases its capacity by moving values into a bigger chunk of memory, while \rrbvec{} allocates a new branch and leaf nodes if necessary. \pvec{}, in addition to that, also switches its internal representation depending on the size.

The following benchmarks evaluate how the size and internal representation affect the performance:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Building a new vector from scratch by pushing values into it. 
    \item Pushing values into an existing vector, both balanced and unbalanced. 
\end{itemize}

To understand how vector cloning influences the performance, the use cases above will be extended with a clone operation following every push.

The goal is to measure how the vector size influences the push operation performance. The experiment is done by pushing N values into an empty vector, where N is the desired size. N is not used as a hint for predefining the capacity, as persistent implementations do not support it. 

Both \rrbvec{} and \pvec{} will always remain balanced, because the push operation itself does not produce relaxed nodes.

% The assumption is that pvec has similar performance compared to std vec

\paragraph*{Dynamic internal representation}
In the input range of [10, 100] \stdvec{} shows the slowest results. Since persistent vectors take advantage of the tail optimization, they do have a preallocated array of fixed size equal to the branching factor, which is set to 32. Since the tree is shallow, the tail push operation will also be relatively fast. On the other hand, \stdvec{} has to increase its capacity several times, which comes at a cost reflected in the results. 

% TODO: check how math notation looks in doc
After the tipping point of N = 100, the \stdvec{} takes the lead by outperforming \pvec{}, \rrbvec{} and \imrsvec{} by a factor of TODOX on average. It is interesting that \pvec{} does not outperform \rrbvec{}, even though it relies on \stdvec{} representation up to the 4096 size. 

% TODO: check if you can reduce the count of times you jump to different parts of memory (such as calls to self.len(), which travels through flavor / arc / heap and back)
This is caused by the overhead of selecting internal representation, which cancels out the benefits of using \stdvec{} for small sizes. The same overhead is apparent after surpassing the 4096 size, where \pvec{} is slightly slower by TODOX compared to \rrbvec{}. 

The \imrsvec{} implementation showed the best results in the range [10, 100] range, but was slower on average by TODOX in comparison to \pvec{}, and by TODOX in comparison to \stdvec{}

\paragraph*{Unique access or transience}
Rust's compiler guarantees that mutable references are unique, which supposdely eliminates the possibility of a race condition. Essentially, it means that we can assume that it is safe to modify a vector, as we are the only ones who have a mutable access to it. 

By leveraging this assumption, we can make persistent vector temporarily mutable or emphemeral. This comes with performance benefits, as there is no need to copy or clone the vector after each modification anymore. This behavior is somewhat similar to the transient behavior of the Clojure's persistent vector, even though not entirely the same. 

In the benchmark \todo{ref}, we measure performance of the push operation followed by the explicit clone operation. By cloning a vector, we ensure that following modifications will not affect existing versions. In other words, we will get persistent behavior. 

It is evident that the clone operation is expensive for \stdvec{}, as it simply copies the contents, while persistent vectors take advantage of the structural sharing to minimize the overhead. Balanced \rrbvec{} outperforms \stdvec{} by a factor of TODOX on average, with the performance difference growing proportionally to the size of the vector. 

Unsurprisingly, \pvec{} is slower than both \stdvec{} and \rrbvec{} by a factor of TODOX up to the size of 4096. It does have the same overhead for cloning as \stdvec{}, and has its own overhead for the push operation due to the internal representation logic. 

\imrsvec{} is slower than balanced \rrbvec{} by TODOX, and faster than \pvec{} by TODOX on average. \stdvec{} outperforms it in the [20, 2000] range by, and then degenerates as the size grows.

To understand the effect of relaxed nodes on the push operation, the setup routine produces an unbalanced vector of size N, created by concatenating a number of small vectors together. 

There are two variants of the test: the first one is pushing values onto provided vector, while the second one also performs clone. 

\paragraph*{Balanced vs unbalanced} As shown in \ref{fig:push-unbalanced}, the difference in performance between balanced and unbalanced variants is negligible, mostly because pushing new values creates balanced nodes. 

\paragraph*{Dynamic internal representation}
As in case with \ref{fig:push}, dynamic internal representation of \pvec{} hardly makes any difference in performance. The benefits of using \stdvec{} for small sizes simply is cancelled out by the overhead of choosing the representation. 

\paragraph*{Unique access or transience}
% What do I right here? Maybe I don't really need to have this push_clone_unbalanced bench at all?

\stdvec{} showed the best results in \ref{fig:push-unbalanced} test. It was TODOX faster on average in comparison to the fastest runner up, balanced \rrbvec{}. \imrsvec{} was marginally slower by TODOX in comparison to \pvec{}.
