% 1. Why Rust is cool and worth your time. Why: a, b, c
Rust is a modern, open-source programming language with a focus on memory safety and performance. Its rich type system not only eliminates several classes of bugs but also makes the language powerful and expressive for building high-level programs such as web servers and command-line interface applications. With direct access to computer memory and hardware, Rust is a great language for embedded and low-level programming as well.

% 2. What are the challenges of working with Rust? a, b, c
However, due to the emphasis on memory safety and rigorous checks enforced by the compiler, it is common to get errors when compiling a Rust program. One of the rules is the forbidden simultaneous sharing and mutation of an object. Often, errors caused by this rule can be avoided by better design, but sometimes, the best resolution is to clone the value before sharing it. Naive cloning by copying, however, is an expensive operation both in terms of time and space. Thus, resorting to it as a solution, especially for large-sized collections might be in-efficient.

% 3. Persistent data structures can help: why, and how? a, b, c
Persistent data structures are the data structures that provide access to all their previous versions. Often persistence is achieved through copying, and thus, various data structure designs have been developed throughout the years to optimize for this operation. The standard library of the Scala programming language\footnote{\url{https://www.scala-lang.org/}} provides a persistent vector implementation that is efficient not only when copied but also across all operations.

% 4. Okay, now we understand what are the challenges, and why Rust and persistent
%      data structures are a match made in heaven. What is my role in this story?
This thesis presents \pvecrs{}, a project that contributes a vector implementation with efficient clone operation that borrows ideas from persistent data structures. The project explores novel approaches to optimize vector’s performance by leveraging type system of Rust, as well as aiming to achieve convenient, idiomatic interface familiar to developers. The proposed optimizations are evaluated and discussed based on results of the sequential and parallel tests.

% 5. Let's learn a little bit more about Rust and Persistent data structures first
In this introductory chapter, we will look at the background for the \pvecrs{} project. First, in section \ref{sec:rust}, we will look at the Rust programming language. Then, in section \ref{sec:psds}, we will take a closer look at persistent data structures and their categories. Finally, section \ref{sec:contributions} gives an overview of the contributions made in this project.

\section{The Rust programming language}
\label{sec:rust}

% 1. Rust is a new programming language developed at Mozilla that offers high level constructs such as a, b, and c
Rust is a relatively new programming language developed at Mozilla that favors reliability and performance. It is a statically type language with type inference, with high-level constructs such as closures, pattern matching and algebraic data types. At the same time, Rust gives the option to control low-level details, such as memory management, without all the unsafety traditionally associated with it.

% 2. At the same time, it offers low-level control to do: a, b, c; that makes it a viable alternative to C/C++
Rust does not have a garbage collector and can be configured without standard library, allowing it to be used for programming microcontrollers, operating systems and drivers, the domain that has been occupied mainly by C/C++. It avoids the tradeoff between control and safety by statically checking memory correctness at compile-time without introducing any runtime overhead \cite{reed-patina}.

% 5. It guarantees memory safety through its type system, and here is how.
The advanced type system of Rust guarantees memory safety by enforcing ownership and borrowing rules, making Rust a unique programming language that helps to write fast, safe and reliable software.

% 6. This project is written in Rust. The following sections will introduce relevant parts of the language. For more details read the book.
The project presented in the thesis, \pvecrs{}, contributes the persistent vector to the Rust programming language. The following sections are a very basic introduction to the relevant parts of Rust touched in this thesis. For a more in-depth overview of the more advanced language features, see the Rust book\footnote{\url{https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/}}.

\subsection{Ownership and borrowing}

\paragraph{Ownership}
Ownership is Rust's most unique feature, and it enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector. Every object allocated in Rust always has an \emph{owner}. Ownership can be transferred from one function to another by \emph{moving} the object. Rust's compiler is capable of tracking these movements and identify the location where the object is no longer used, or in Rust's terminology, where it goes out of scope, and generate code for destroying that object. To summarize:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Each value in Rust has a variable that is called its owner.
    \item There can only be one owner at a time.
    \item When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Borrowing}
Borrowing in Rust is the act of creating references to an object. The compiler checks that references always go out of scope before the object they are pointing to, returning an error if it does not, thus guaranteeing that references will never be dangling pointers \cite{reed-patina}. The borrowing rules are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
    \item References must always be valid: they cannot outlive an object they are pointing to, and they have to point to an object of a correct type.
\end{itemize}

Ownership and borrowing rules are demonstrated in listing \ref{lst:ownership-and-borrowing} that was taken from \cite{linus-parallelization}. On line 2, a new vector is created and assigned to the \mintinline{rust}{vec} variable. Since \mintinline{rust}{vec} owns the object, it is allowed to mutate it by pushing a value on line 3.

        frame=lines,

        linenos
    ]{rust}
        fn main() {
            let mut vec = Vec::new();
            vec.push(42);

            { // Two references are created.
                let vecref = &vec;
                borrow(&vec);
                // ^ Ref goes out of scope when borrow returns
            } // vecref goes out of scope here

            borrow_mut(&mut vec); // <- Lend ‘vec‘ mutably to ‘borrow_mut‘
            take(vec); // <- Ownership transferred to ‘take‘
            vec.push(37); // <- Error: use of moved value: ‘vec‘
        }

        fn take(mut my_data: Vec<i32>) {
            my_data.push(99); // ‘my_data‘ is owner, can perform mutation
        } // ‘my_data‘ goes out of scope and will be freed here

        fn borrow(vec: &Vec<i32>) {
            vec.push(10); // error: cannot borrow immutable borrowed ...
            let element = vec.get(0); // Read is possible.
        } // Borrowing ends, but ‘vec‘ continues to live in ‘foo‘

        fn borrow_mut(vec: &mut Vec<i32>) {
            vec.push(0); // Mutable borrow of ‘vec‘, can mutate.
        }
    \end{minted}

    \caption{Demonstrating ownership and borrowing rules.}
    \label{lst:ownership-and-borrowing}
\end{listing}

On lines 6 and 7, two references are created with the \mintinline{rust}{&} operator. One of them is borrowed by the \mintinline{rust}{borrow} function, with the \mintinline{rust}{vec} still being the owner. When \mintinline{rust}{borrow} returns, the reference goes out of the scope first, and then the same happens to \mintinline{rust}{vecref} a line later. The two references are a demonstration of the possibility to simultaneously create more than one immutable reference to the same object.

On line 10 a new mutable reference is created with the \mintinline{rust}{&mut} operator. While data is borrowed mutably no other references can exist. When \mintinline{rust}{borrow_mut} returns the reference goes of the scope.

When the function \mintinline{rust}{take} is invoked the ownership to the \mintinline{rust}{vec} object is transferred to the variable \mintinline{rust}{my_data}. The \emph{move} happens because \mintinline{rust}{take} accepts the object by value rather than by a reference. Compiler will error on attempt to use \mintinline{rust}{vec} after it has been moved on line 13.

\paragraph{Unsafe Rust}
Rust has a second language hidden inside it that does not enforce memory safety guarantees: it is called \emph{unsafe} Rust. Rust forces developers to find a safer solution to problematic code or mark it as unsafe and thus highlight the code as a potential source of problems during future debugging.

The \pvecrs{} project was designed in the way that it does not require unsafe Rust features. It was done intentionally to minimize the risk of introducing bugs.

\subsection{Memory management: the stack and the heap}
In programming languages such as Java, there is no distinction between the stack and the heap memory, because language abstracts them away from a developer. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a value is on the stack or the heap has more of an effect on how the language behaves and why you have to make certain decisions.

The stack is very fast and is where memory is allocated in Rust by default. But the allocation is local to a function call and is limited in size. The heap, on the other hand, is slower and is explicitly allocated by your program. But it’s effectively unlimited in size and is globally accessible.

The following section gives an overview of how Rust supports heap allocation.

\subsubsection*{Smart pointers}
\emph{Smart pointers} are data structures that not only act like a pointer but also have additional metadata and capabilities.

\paragraph{Box}
The most straightforward smart pointer is \type{Box<T>} that allows storing data on the heap rather than the stack.

\begin{listing}[!htbp]

    \centering
    \begin{minted}[
        fontsize=\small,
        stripnl=false,
        framesep=4mm,
        frame=lines,
        autogobble,
        linenos
    ]{rust}
        fn main() {
            let b = Box::new(5); // <- 5 will be stored on the heap.
            println!("b = {}", b);
        }
    \end{minted}

    \caption{Example of using box smart pointer.}
    \label{lst:box}
\end{listing}

When box pointer in listing \ref{lst:box} goes out of the scope on line 4, corresponding heap allocation gets freed as well.

\paragraph{Rc or reference counting}
There are cases when a single object might have multiple owners. In graph data structures, multiple edges might point to the same node, and that node is conceptually owned by all of the edges that point to it. A node should not be cleaned up unless it does not have any edges pointing to it.

\begin{listing}[!htbp]

    \centering
    \begin{minted}[
        fontsize=\small,
        stripnl=false,
        framesep=4mm,
        frame=lines,
        autogobble,
        linenos
    ]{rust}
        fn main() {
            let mut rc = Rc::new(Vec::new());
            // ^ Wrapping the vec instance into rc pointer

            Rc::make_mut(&mut rc).push(42);
            // ^ Ref count is 1, push succeeds without cloning.

            take(rc.clone()); // <- Ref count is incremented to 2.
            Rc::make_mut(&mut rc).push(37); // <- Updating the original 'vec'.
        } // <- 'rc' is decremented to 0 and dropped

        fn take(mut my_rc: Rc<Vec<i32>>) {
            println!("val={:?}", my_rc.get(0));
            // ^ Reading values does not cause clone

            Rc::make_mut(&mut my_rc).push(99);
            // ^ Mutating the object with ref count of 2
            // will clone the wrapped value and then update it.
        } // ‘my_rc' is decremented to 0 and dropped.
    \end{minted}

    \caption{Example of using reference counting pointer.}
    \label{lst:rc}
\end{listing}

To enable multiple ownership, Rust has a type called \type{Rc<T>}, which is an abbreviation for reference counting. The \type{Rc<T>} type keeps track of the number of references to a value that determines whether or not a value is still in use. If there are zero references to a value, the value can be cleaned up without any references becoming invalid.

Listing \ref{lst:rc} demonstrates how multiple ownership works using the \type{Rc<T>} pointer. On line 2, a vector is created and wrapped into reference counting pointer immediately. On the first call to \mintinline{rust}{Rc::make_mut} method, the number 42 is pushed onto the vector.

The \mintinline{rust}{rc} variable is cloned before it is passed to \mintinline{rust}{take} by value, causing the reference count to be incremented to 2. It is important to note that the underlying vector object is not cloned until line 16, where \mintinline{rust}{Rc::make_mut} function clones the inner value to ensure unique ownership. When \mintinline{rust}{take} is finished, both \mintinline{rust}{my_rc} and the newly copied vector go out of the scope and destroyed.

The execution continues on line 9, where \mintinline{rust}{main} proceeds updating the vector. In this case, \mintinline{Rust}{Rc::make_mut} is not causing a clone because the underlying vector has only a single reference to it.

Note that \type{Rc<T>} is only for use in single-threaded scenarios. \type{Arc<T>} that stands for atomic reference counting should be used in a multi-threaded environment instead.

\subsection{Enums, structs and traits}

\subsubsection*{Structs}

\begin{listing}[!htbp]

    \centering
    \begin{minted}[
        fontsize=\small,
        stripnl=false,
        framesep=4mm,
        frame=lines,
        autogobble,
        linenos
    ]{rust}
        struct Book {
            author: String,
            name: String
        }
    \end{minted}

    \caption{A basic Rust struct}
    \label{lst:struct}
\end{listing}

Structs is the most common way to declare complex custom data types in Rust without introducing runtime overhead. A \emph{struct}, or \emph{structure}, is a custom data type that lets you name and package together multiple related values that make up a meaningful group\footnote{\url{https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-00-structs.html}}.

\subsubsection*{Enums}

\begin{listing}[!htbp]

    \centering
    \begin{minted}[
        fontsize=\small,
        stripnl=false,
        framesep=4mm,
        frame=lines,
        autogobble,
        linenos
    ]{rust}
        struct Point(isize, isize);

        enum Shape {
            Rectangle {
                p_1: Point,
                p_2: Point
            },
            Triangle {
                p_1: Point,
                p_2: Point,
                p_3: Point
            }
        };
    \end{minted}

    \caption{A basic Rust enum}
    \label{lst:enum}
\end{listing}

\emph{Enums} or \emph{enumerations}, are used to define a custom data type by enumerating its possible variants, where each variant might have different data associated with it. The size of an enum instance is equal to the maximum size of its variants. For example, \mintinline{rust}{Shape::Rectangle} will be allocated the same amount of memory as \mintinline{rust}{Shape::Triangle}, even though it contains only two points.

\subsubsection*{Traits}

\begin{listing}[!htbp]

    \centering
    \begin{minted}[
        fontsize=\small,
        stripnl=false,
        framesep=4mm,
        frame=lines,
        autogobble,
        linenos
    ]{rust}
        struct Email(String);
        struct Tweet(String);

        trait Message {
            fn send();
        }

        impl Message for Email {
            fn send() { /* sending email */ }
        }

        impl Message for Tweet {
            fn send() { /* sending tweet */ }
        }
    \end{minted}

    \caption{A basic Rust trait}
    \label{lst:trait}
\end{listing}

A \emph{trait} is a language feature that tells the Rust compiler about functionality a type must provide. Conceptually it is similar to an interface in Java. One of the trait's superpowers is the ability to implement them for types you do not own. Traits support default function implementations, as well as inheritance. Listing \ref{lst:trait} shows how traits can be used to define the common contract between several data types.

\section{Persistent data structures}
\label{sec:psds}

A vast majority of modern programming languages are equipped with a standard library --- a set of constructs and utilities aimed to improve the developer's productivity.

A significant part of standard library consists of commonly used data structures such as lists, sets, and maps, which often provide operations for reading and writing data.

Modifying or \emph{mutating} an \emph{ephemeral} data structure implies that we no longer will have access to its older version. In contrast, a \emph{persistent} data structure allows access to any version, old or new, at any time \cite{making-data-structures-persistent}.

Persistent data structures could be classified based on the operations which they offer over their versions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Partial persistence} --- In this persistence model, we can query any previous version of the data structure, but we can update only the newest version. The versions are linearly ordered.
    \item \textit{Full persistence} --- Both access and updates are allowed on all versions. The versions can be visualized as a branching tree.
    \item \textit{Confluent persistence} --- In addition to the previous operations, it offers combination operation to merge more than one previous version to output a new single version. The versions form a directed acyclic graph \cite{fully-persistent-lists-with-catenation}.
    \item \textit{Functional persistence} --- This model takes its name from functional programming where objects are immutable. In comparison to the previous models, it prohibits change of the internal representation of the data structure \cite{purely-functional-data-structures}.
\end{itemize}

While persistence can be achieved by simple copying, the performance of a modification operation quickly becomes unacceptable. This led to research and development of more efficient solutions, which were often designed to solve particular problems. A lack of general purpose collections, which guarantee uniformly good performance across different operations, results in challenges with software development.

A persistent \emph{vector}, also known as a one-dimensional growable array, is very inefficient if implemented naively. Each update operation will cause a full copy of the underlying array, consuming additional amount of memory and processor time.

However most operations modify only some parts of data structures, a complete copy is redundant. A better approach is to exploit the similarity between the new and old versions by \emph{sharing} structure between them. For example, instead of representing a data structure as a single block of memory, it could be broken down into smaller pieces or \emph{nodes}, which are linked together in the form of a \emph{tree}. Since modifications only apply to some nodes, the rest of them still remain unchanged and can be shared without copying.

The first persistent vector implementation which offered good performance across a broad range of operations was introduced by Rich Hickey in the Clojure programming language. It was based on Phil Bagwell's Hash Array Mapped Trie \cite{ideal-hash-trees}, which offers practically constant runtime for push, update, and access operations, and it is a \emph{fully} persistent data structure.

Later Phill Bagwell introduced a confluently persistent vector based on Relaxed Radix Balanced Tree \cite{efficient-immutable-vectors}, which has improved performance of the concatenation operation significantly and became a foundation for Scala's standard library vector implementation.

The project presented in the thesis contributes an efficient persistent vector implementation for Rust based on Relaxed Radix Balanced Tree, which takes advantage of the Rust's type system to improve performance, guarantee thread safety and provide an idiomatic application programming interface. In order to ensure the best possible average performance, its internal representation switches from standard vector to RRB-Tree during runtime.

\section{Goals and contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}
The purpose of this thesis is to explore and evaluate novel ideas for optimizations that emerge at the intersection of the unique Rust features and persistent data structures to contribute a persistent vector implementation with excellent performance and idiomatic Rust interface.

The following contributions are made in this thesis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The persistent vector implementation based on RRB-Tree with efficient concatenation and splitting to make it a reasonable data structure to use for parallel programming.
    \item An extension for the data parallelism library -- Rayon, fused with the persistent vector to create an efficient general-purpose parallel vector.
    \item Describing and implementing novel optimizations specific to Rust, specifically: dynamic representation and unique access optimizations.
    \item The extensive performance evaluation of the contributed persistent and parallel vectors, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations.
\end{itemize}

Chapter \ref{chapter:radix-balanced-tree} gives an overview of the RRB-Tree data structure that serves as the foundation for the persistent vector. In chapter \ref{chapter:persistent-vector}, the \pvecrs{} project, its interface, and optimizations specific to Rust are presented in detail. The chapter \ref{chapter:methodology} focuses on the performance evaluation of the persistent vector followed by the chapter with results.
